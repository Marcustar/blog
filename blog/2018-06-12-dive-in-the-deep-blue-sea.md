wait for me to faded  
Resting in you arms  
again alone  
I will leave my home  
was I born to be alone  
But my heart is strong  
And my search is goes on  
To see if I can find my love   
You take my hand  
and Following me  
Together we can swim in the darkest stream   
You gonnna drown   
If you follow me   
take a dive in to the deep blue seaa   
together we have a dream   
we can bring back it back if you set me free   
we meet agagin , if you following me   
let's go together to the dark blue sea   
That you are the same   
But my love is gone   
Again alone   
I have you Trus , I gave you time   
But you fooled my heart , you stole my mind   
Hurts is every single way   
Give hope and it wasn't true   
It's dying too   
You take my hand , and Following me   
Together we can swim in the darkest stear   
yor gona drown   
if you following me   
Take a dive into the deep blue sea   
Together we can have a dream   
We can bring it back if you set me free   
We will meet again , if you follow me    
let's go together to the dark blue sea   
together we can swim in the darkest sea   
You are gonna drown , If you following me   
Together we can have a dream   
We can bring it back , if you set me free   
Let's go together to the dark blue sea .

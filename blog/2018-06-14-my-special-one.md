I feel like I come home again , I miss you like it is the last chance 
to hold you , to have you , in my arms again 
It is too many days we have been apart 
It is to many nights you seems so far 
I miss you more than words can explain 
you always in my heart ,  you always in my heart 
when i'm far away , you are with me everyday 

we have bound that no one will break 
you take my life to a higher place 
my special one 

since the day  you came into my life,with every lasting joy it turned on light 
my best friend , my angle 
you are my purpose of life 
no one can ever break apart even if they have tried we will stay strong 
I love  you more than words explain 
yo always in my heart you always ... 
Even when I'm faraway ,you are with me everyday 
we have bound that no one breaks 
you take my life to a higher place 
My special one 

I sit and think about when we are having fun 
we play and round and round when we kiss on the ground 
and when you know the round that we for anogher day 
to be closer to  you , to be closer to yo 
Ah , you ...

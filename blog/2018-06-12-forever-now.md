You can see her in the distance   
where se walks so alone   
then you follow her direction, To you second home   
the evening grab us in the sounds we are bound   
we sit and watch the sun moving down   
it feel so good to have you around   
if we could stay forever , have forever now  
she has jammed  you with suggestions  
and you like to know   
was she seduced you inner consciense   
where she wants to go  
the evening grab us in the sounds we are bound  
It feels so good have you around  
wish we could stay forever , have forever now  
......  
......  
......  
We listen to the silence streaming   
Memories they take us back   
To the day we meet , where we run with kiss   
will we ever have this feeling again  
The evening grabs us in the sounds we are bound  
we sit and watch the sun moving down  
It feels so good to have you around  
wish we could stay forever , have forever now  
The evening grab us in sound we are bound  
we sit and watch the sun moving down  
It feel so good to have you around  
wish we could stay forever , have forever now  
wish we could stay forever , have forever now.

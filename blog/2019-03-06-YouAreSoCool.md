[Verse 1]   
You're so cool, you're so cool  
Walking down the hall   
Wild eyes they are black    
Like the magic 8 ball   
You got guns for trophies   
Mounted up like animal heads    
With the skulls of all the  
High school champs you keep 
In rows above the bed, you told me  

[Chorus]    
When i'm good, i'm very good    
But when i'm bad, i'm better    
I'm yours forever, i'm yours forever    

When i'm good, i'm very good    
But when i'm bad, i'm better    
I'm yours forever, i'm yours forever    

[Verse 2]   
You're so cool, you're so cool  
I'll bet when you were born  
All the orange crush & ne-hi soda   
Bottles in the world fizzed over    
They wanna break your heart  
But it's made of blood & tar        
You carry all that suffering     
Like a gun between your arms    
You told me

[Chorus]    
When i'm good, i'm very good    
But when i'm bad, i'm better    
I'm yours forever, i'm yours forever    

When i'm good, i'm very good    
But when i'm bad, i'm better    
I'm yours forever, i'm yours forever    

[Bridge]    
You're so cool, you're so cool  
And I see the future and there's no death   
Cuz you and I we're angels  

You're so cool, you're so cool

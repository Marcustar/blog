1. We listen to the silence streaming 
2. Memories they take us back 
3. To the day we meet , where we run with kiss 
4. will we ever have this feeling again 
5. The evening grabs us in the sounds we are bound 
6. we sit and watch the sun moving down 
7. It feels so good to have you around 
8. wish we could stay forever , have forever now 
9. The evening grab us in sound we are bound 
10. we sit and watch the sun moving down 
11. It feel so good to have you around 
12. wish we could stay forever , have forever now 
13. wish we could stay forever , have forever now.
